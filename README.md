Wallpaper-NationalGeographic
============================

Short script that downloads the photo of the day from the National Geographic web site and sets it as desktop background

It works for Ubuntu 12.04 with GNOME but it may just as well work for other similar Linux ditros.

How to use it: simply run the script; if you would like to save the image you can run the script again using the flag -s or --save-image
